>>> Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome vice
president of engineering for Google, Vic Gundotra.

0:07
[ Applause ]
>>Vic Gundotra: Well, good morning, everybody.

0:16
You made it, even at this early hour.
I hope you enjoyed that party last night.

0:21
How --
[ Applause ]

0:22
[ Cheers and applause ]
>>Vic Gundotra: Yeah?

0:25
How about that spider?
Was that cool or what?

0:28
After a few drinks, I thought that thing was
going to chase me.

0:30
A lot of fun.
Let me also welcome the many thousands who

0:35
are watching our live stream on YouTube.
Yesterday, just for your information, we had

0:39
over 24,000 people watching it concurrently
live.

0:43
So in addition to the 5,000-plus folks we
had here, we had almost 30,000 watch us yesterday.

0:48
So welcome to everyone watching on YouTube.
[ Applause ]

0:53
>>Vic Gundotra: To begin today's keynote,
I'd like to start with a story.

1:01
It's a story of my very first day on the job
at Google.

1:05
Now, I'm sure you've all been at a new job.
You understand the apprehensiveness you might

1:11
feel with a new office, new people.
It was on that very first day that I met a

1:17
man named Mr. Andy Rubin.
Now, I suspect most of you know who Andy Rubin

1:22
is.
At the time, he was responsible for what was

1:25
then a secret project code-named "Android."
And on that first day, Andy enthusiastically

1:31
described to me the team's mission and purpose.
And as he spoke, I'll level with you, I was

1:39
skeptical.
In fact, I interrupted Andy.

1:43
And I said, "Andy, I don't get it.
Does the world really need another mobile

1:48
operating system?
Google's about advertising.

1:51
Shouldn't we be on every phone?"
To this day, I remember Andy's response.

1:57
And he made two points.
The first point Andy made was that it was

2:02
critically important to provide a free mobile
operating system, an open source operating

2:08
system, that would enable innovation at every
level of the stack.

2:12
In other words, OEMs should be free to build
all kinds of devices, devices with keyboards,

2:18
without keyboards, with front-facing cameras,
two inches, three inches, four inches, that

2:24
operators should be able to compete on the
strength and coverage of their network, 2G,

2:29
3G, 4G, LTP, CDMA.
And that in the end, with innovation coming

2:33
at every layer, it would be the consumer who
would be able to benefit by getting the best

2:38
device and best network for them.
I remember Andy's second point.

2:44
He argued that if Google did not act, we faced
a Draconian future, a future where one man,

2:54
one company, one device, one carrier would
be our only choice.

3:00
[ Applause ]
>>Vic Gundotra: That's a future we don't want.

3:07
So if you believe in openness, if you believe
in choice, if you believe in innovation from

3:14
everyone, then welcome to Android.
Now, let's get started.

3:22
Let's talk a little bit about the momentum
that we've achieved in 18 months.

3:25
It's been a year and a half since we've started
with Android.

3:28
How are we doing?
Let's do a little bit of a report card.

3:33
First of all, let's demonstrate some momentum.
It's hard to believe that in only 18 months,

3:40
we've achieved over 60 compatible devices,
where your software, where your applications

3:46
can run.
And these devices are not just from, you know,

3:50
people you haven't heard of.
These are from the leading consumer electronic

3:53
companies in the world, Sony Ericsson, HTC,
Motorola, and many others, who are producing

3:59
devices that meet the needs of consumers.
We think this is pretty fantastic progress

4:05
in just 18 months.
Of course, it's not just the creation of the

4:09
devices.
It's the 21 OEMs in 48 countries and over

4:13
59 carriers who have joined the Android revolution.
Of course, producing devices, making them

4:20
available across a multitude of countries
and carriers doesn't necessarily mean that

4:27
we're going to see adoption.
Have users found Android to be something that

4:32
they desire?
Well, last year, we reported, late last year,

4:38
that we had reached a sales run rate, a daily
activation rate, of over 30,000 units a day.

4:46
In February, just a few months later, we announced
that our daily run rate had achieved 60,000

4:52
units a day.
I'm very proud to announce today that our

4:57
run rate daily activations has now passed
100,000 a day.

5:01
[ Cheers and applause ]
>>Vic Gundotra: Go, Android!

5:06
Of course, that momentum has led to some pretty
significant milestones.

5:15
One of the ones we are most proud of is that
this quarter, we are now second in the United

5:19
States in smartphone sales, second only to
RIM.

5:23
And that's pretty amazing progress in 18 months.
We're second in smartphone sales, but according

5:28
to AdMob data, we are now first this quarter
in total Web and app usage.

5:34
That's fantastic.
[ Applause ]

5:38
>>Vic Gundotra: You know, we set a crazy internal
milestone for ourselves.

5:46
The phones are being used by consumers, but
what are they being used for?

5:50
And we set a crazy internal goal when we shipped
turn-by-turn navigation for Android.

5:56
We thought it might be possible to have a
half a billion miles navigated in the first

6:02
year.
In hardly six months, we've now crossed a

6:05
billion miles navigated with turn-by-turn
navigation on Android.

6:09
So users just love that feature.
Thank you.

6:13
[ Applause ]
>>Vic Gundotra: There are some who say that

6:20
users don't use Google Search on smartphones.
Well, we're a company driven by data, not

6:25
by opinions.
And you know what the data shows?

6:27
The data shows that we've seen a 5X growth
in the past two years.

6:31
That's not just on Android, but that's across
all smartphone categories.

6:35
People love Google search.
You give them a great browser, and they do

6:39
Google search, tremendous, awesome usage of
the Web on these devices.

6:44
Of course, what they love is applications.
And today I'm happy to announce that we've

6:49
crossed 50,000 applications in the Android
Marketplace.

6:53
And, really, the credit there goes to you.
Thank you, for the 180,000 developers.

6:57
Thank you.
The 180,000 developers who have joined the

7:05
Android revolution.
Really, it's your hard work that's paired

7:09
with the innovation that's coming from OEMs
and carriers that makes the mobile ecosystem

7:13
work.
We certainly couldn't have done this without

7:16
you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you for supporting

7:19
Android.
[ Applause ]

7:21
>>Vic Gundotra: Now, let's talk about the
platform.

7:24
We've finished the section on momentum.
Let's talk about what we're doing to make

7:28
the Android platform continue to evolve and
get better.

7:32
In this section, I have over 20 demos, 22
demos, I believe.

7:35
In order to help me with that, I'd like to
invite up on stage Matt Waddell, my partner

7:39
in crime here.
Many of you may remember Matt from last year.

7:43
And we're going to go through a number of
demos that are going to really showcase what

7:47
we're doing with Android.
There are five major areas of investments

7:50
that we're making in the platform.
Now, we've been quick to iterate with Android.

7:57
In fact, there's been seven releases in those
18 months.

8:00
And today we're announcing the next release,
Android 2.2 code-named Froyo.

8:07
[ Applause ]
>>Vic Gundotra: What's in Froyo?

8:14
Let's talk about five pillars.
Number one, let's begin with speed.

8:20
Now, as you developers know, the Android architecture
is one that's built upon a virtual machine,

8:27
the Dalvik virtual machine.
We think it's important.

8:30
It's a critical design decision that we made
that future-proofs your application.

8:36
We have big dreams for Android.
And part of those dreams mean that Android

8:41
will go to new places with new chip architectures.
But by having your applications write to the

8:46
virtual machine, we believe we can carry the
entire ecosystem to exciting new areas.

8:52
Of course, that only works if the virtual
machine is fast and the Dalvik VM has done

8:58
its job being fast, efficient, and automatic
and easy for developers.

9:02
But we can do even better.
We're very proud to announce that in Froyo,

9:06
we've added a JIT, a just-in-time compiler,
this gives up to two to five X speedup of

9:12
your apps on the exact same hardware.
Now, this is best demonstrated.

9:17
And let's do that.
Let's go to our first demo.

9:20
We're going to show you a game.
The game has been modified for purposes of

9:24
this demo.
You guys may know Replica Island.

9:27
Here's what we've done to modify the game.
The game now will show the frame rate that

9:32
it's rendering in the bottom right-hand corner.
If the frame rate drops beneath 30 frames

9:37
a second, the screen will Flash red.
Exact same hardware, exact same game, top

9:42
is running Froyo with JIT compilation, the
bottom is running Eclair.

9:46
We're going to introduce a crazy number of
monsters into this game.

9:49
You see the monsters keep getting added, increasing
the complexity.

9:54
You see the frame rate at the top.
As we add complexity, it starts to slow down.

9:58
You'll note there at the bottom, there are
times when we're dropping beneath 30 frame

10:02
a second and it's flashing red.
You'll note at the top, with Froyo, exactly

10:06
the same game runs much better, never dropping
beneath 30 frames a second, all because of

10:12
the JIT compiler.
All right.

10:14
Let's go back to slides.
[ Applause ]

10:19
>>Vic Gundotra: Now, as Android adoption has
skyrocketed, people have been taking these

10:28
devices to work.
And we've heard loud and clear from the enterprise

10:33
that they need very specific features.
Well, in Froyo, we introduce over 20 new features

10:39
designed to meet the needs of enterprise.
Let me touch on two of them.

10:43
Number one, we become Microsoft exchange friendly.
That means --

10:46
[ Applause ]
>>Vic Gundotra: Yes, thank you.

10:49
That means things like auto-discovery, integration
with the global address book, the security

10:55
policies that are available in Exchange can
be forced upon the device.

10:59
Number two, we've added new APIs for device
management.

11:02
So you can build software that does critically
important things, like remote wipe of the

11:08
device if necessary.
And there's many, many other things that we've

11:11
added that you'll see in the documentation.
Let's talk about new services available for

11:18
developers in the SDK.
Now, one of the first services I want to talk

11:23
about is the application data backup API.
Now, if you use Android and you've gone to

11:30
another device, you know that Android will
automatically back up your applications.

11:34
In other words, you get a new device, you
log in, and your applications come along with

11:38
that.
However, what Android has not done is backed

11:42
up the data associated with those applications.
So, for example, I have a particularly favorite

11:48
application that helps me monitor my exercise
and my weight.

11:52
But when I move to a new Android device, the
application moves, but all my personal data

11:57
and history doesn't.
Starting with Froyo, we'll provide an application

12:01
data backup API that ISVs can take advantage
of and move the data along with the application.

12:06
We think that's a great feature.
In addition to that, we have a brand-new API,

12:14
a cloud-to-device messaging API.
Let me be clear, this is not a push notification

12:20
API designed to compensate for the lack of
basic functionality like multitasking in the

12:25
operating system.
[ Laughter ]

12:27
>>Vic Gundotra: Okay?
[ Cheers and applause ]

12:31
>>Vic Gundotra: We've done something very
clever I think you're going to love.

12:36
As a developer, you can send a message to
our servers which will do very smart things,

12:41
like collapse similar messages, our servers,
which will optimize for the latency of mobile

12:46
networks and make sure that that message gets
down to the device.

12:50
But that's only the first step.
We've done deep integration with Android such

12:54
that when you send a message, that message
can trigger an Android intent.

12:59
Let me show you how powerful this is.
Let's go to a demo.

13:06
Now, what Matt has on the screen here on his
laptop is Google Maps.

13:10
He's -- in Google Maps -- and he's using the
Chrome browser.

13:14
And he's added a Chrome extension.
The Chrome extension is in the upper right-hand

13:19
corner.
That sends it to his phone.

13:21
In the map, he has directions, he has directions
from the Moscone Center to Google headquarters.

13:26
And he wants to send that to the phone.
What do you think happens?

13:29
Do you think we send a text message that says,
"This is the address"?

13:32
Do you think we send an e-mail?
No.

13:35
We send Android intent.
In other words, when he says send to phone,

13:39
the message gets sent to our server, gets
pushed down to the device.

13:41
The device kicks into navigation mode automatically.
Keep your eye when he clicks on "send to phone,"

13:47
keep your eye on the Android device.
So send it to phone.

13:53
And on the Android device, boom, right into
navigation.

13:56
How hot is that?
[ Applause ]

14:04
>>Vic Gundotra: That's how you do a device,
cloud-to-device API.

14:06
[ Laughter ]
>>Vic Gundotra: Let me show you another example.

14:12
You're reading an article on the desktop.
You think it's awesome, but you're out of

14:15
time and you need to run.
You want to keep reading that on the Android

14:18
phone.
Why don't you send that to the device, Matt.

14:22
To the device.
Opens up the browser, takes you right to that

14:30
article, not ever having to press any other
keys.

14:34
Isn't that great?
[ Applause ]

14:36
>>Vic Gundotra: We can't wait to see what
you're going to go do with this API.

14:43
All right.
Let's go back to slides.

14:50
You're going to love this.
[ Cheers and applause ]

14:55
>>Vic Gundotra: I mean, come on.
If you're like me, you have a plethora of

15:04
devices you carry around with you.
And that -- all those devices shouldn't mean

15:08
added complexity and yet another bill.
Right?

15:12
You should be able to, at the platform level,
enable tethering.

15:16
And so now your Android device can in fact
become a portable hot spot and really serve

15:22
the needs of these other devices that you
might have with you.

15:24
In fact, let's show you a demo of this working.
Matt has a Nexus One running Froyo.

15:31
He'll go right into tethering and portable
hot spot.

15:34
He'll enable the hot spot.
He'll give it a name.

15:37
In fact, I think he's already named this as
Android AP.

15:41
And that hot spot will turn on.
We'll give it a second there.

15:45
There we go.
Tethering hot spot is now active.

15:47
Now he'll go to another device that doesn't
have connectivity.

15:51
How about that iPad?
[ Laughter ]

15:53
[ Applause ]
>>Vic Gundotra: And there you go.

16:00
One bill.
Isn't that beautiful?

16:02
All right.
Let's go back to slides.

16:03
[ Applause ]
>>Vic Gundotra: Now, it turns out, do you

16:18
know what the most popular thing people do
with these smartphones?

16:22
What do you think it is?
It's fairly obvious.

16:25
Is they actually use the phone.
Number two thing they do is, they do text

16:30
messaging.
And the third most-used application is the

16:34
browser.
And so it's critically important for us to

16:37
make the Android browser rock.
And we're going to constantly improve that

16:43
browser.
And Froyo is a major step in that direction.

16:46
What have we done in Froyo?
Well, I think you're going to love this.

16:50
We have a two to three X performance in the
browser?

16:53
How?
We took the same JavaScript interpreter that

16:57
we had in Chrome that made Chrome so fast,
V8, and we brought that into Froyo.

17:02
Now, the best way to show you how much of
an advance we've made is to do a demo.

17:07
So let's go and show you this fantastic performance
boost.

17:12
Now, we're going to do this demo with a number
of devices.

17:15
We're going to do it --
>>> Two devices.

17:16
>>Vic Gundotra: We're going to do this demo
 -- three devices.

17:20
We're going to do this demo with Froyo, Eclair,
and an iPad.

17:24
Now, here's the demo we're going to do.
There's an industry-standard test, in fact,

17:30
there's -- it's a suite of 26 tests, the SunSpider
test, that really exercise JavaScript performance

17:37
of all kinds.
And when Matt presses "start" across these

17:41
three devices, we're going to exercise each
one of these 26 tests.

17:46
As we complete one test, that little Android
robot will take one breast stroke forward.

17:52
And as all 26 tests are complete, we're going
to complete an entire lap.

17:57
How are we going to go do here?
Let's go ahead and start this test.

17:59
Let's what happens.
Oh, you started the iPad first, trying to

18:02
give it a little bit of a lead here, huh?
[ Laughter ]

18:03
[ Applause ]
>>Vic Gundotra: You can cheer.

18:07
It's great.
[ Cheers and applause ]

18:17
>>Vic Gundotra: I really wonder if we'll be
able to get that in the app store.

18:25
It's a Web app, how great is that?
All right.

18:32
Let's go back to slides.
We think with the performance improvements

18:43
that we just showed you that we can claim
that Froyo has the world's fastest mobile

18:48
browser. And that's a pretty great accomplishment,
one we are extremely proud of. We're not done.

18:55
I showed you what's in Froyo, but make no
mistake about our commitment to maintain leadership

19:01
in the browser on Android. And one of the
ways we are doing that is to have standards

19:06
bodies to enable Web developers to get capabilities
that were formerly only limited to the native

19:13
access to the platform.
What kind of capabilities? Think about the

19:18
kinds of things you can access on a device,
things like the magnetometer, the accelerometer.

19:23
Think about things like the camera or being
able to access speech. Wouldn't this be great

19:28
if you could access this from the browser.
We are going to show you a sneak peek at something

19:33
beyond Froyo, an early development build that
will give you a flavor of where we're going

19:38
next.
Let's go back to demos.

19:40
Now, remember, we already got some of this
work under way. Last year we worked with the

19:45
standards committees to introduce geo location
into the browser, and today almost in all

19:49
major modern platforms, you can make an API
call from the browser, get location with the

19:55
user's permission, and then do a feature like
My Location right within the browser.

19:59
But we want to do more. How about the accelerometer.
What about access to tilt in the direction

20:07
of the device?
Watch this.

20:12
Isn't that great? Right within the browser.
[ Applause ]

20:15
>>Vic Gundotra: All right.
Now, another key feature that we have heard

20:21
from developers that they want access to in
the browser is the camera.

20:24
Here, for examples the Buzz Web application.
We'd love to not only post a Buzz but we would

20:30
love to be able to include a picture. How
do you access the camera from the Web browser?

20:35
In this development build we built those APIs
right into the Web browser such that Matt

20:39
can now simply select, if he wants to -- 
and it looks like in this case this demo is

20:45
not going to work. We will give it one shot,
and we will move on if it doesn't work --

20:49
 but you can access that camera capability
right from within the browser.

20:54
And we will show you that in the sandbox later.
It's great.

20:56
[ Laughter ]
>>Vic Gundotra: Let's talk about another capability

21:00
that's available.
But before we talk about that capability,

21:04
let me remind you of what's possible in Android.
Google, starting about several years ago,

21:10
really made a deep investment in voice recognition.
We recognized that the mobile device, because

21:16
of its limited input capability, would be
the platform in which people used voice input

21:22
more than any other platform.
In fact, we see a stunning number of queries

21:26
being done on mobile devices where the input
is a human voice.

21:30
Now, just as a reminder of how fantastic our
capability has become over the past two years,

21:36
let me do a few demos. Or more accurately,
Matt, why don't you highlight a few cases.

21:41
>>Matt: Pictures of Barack Obama with the
French President at the G8 summit.

21:52
>>Vic Gundotra: That's a tough one. Boom!
Look at that!

21:54
[ Applause ]
>>Vic Gundotra: Because this is so fun, let's

22:02
do a few more.
>>Matt: Pictures of the Golden Gate Bridge

22:06
at sunset.
>>Vic Gundotra: These are queries you are

22:09
likely not to type in let alone get a response
back in a few seconds. Isn't that great?

22:13
And one more.
[ Applause ]

22:14
>>Matt: Del Dotto Vineyards, Napa.
>>Vic Gundotra: My favorite vineyard in Napa.

22:23
Boom.
What Matt just showed you was phenomenal voice

22:27
recognition that we are now shipping in Japanese,
English, a number of languages, and that's

22:35
constantly increasing, but what is coming
next is the also the ability to understand

22:40
human intentions. We will give you a very
simple sneak peek at the kinds of things we

22:45
are going to enable.
>>Matt: Call fifth floor restaurant.

22:52
>>Vic Gundotra: So in this case, because he
said "call," it got a trigger. And there are

22:58
many, many more intentions we are going to
build in and make it very, very simple for

23:02
to you use voice input as a first class way
to interact with your Android device.

23:08
>>Matt: Vic, we have got it.
>>Vic Gundotra: Let's go back to the camera

23:11
and see if this thing works. This is a Web
app. It's a Buzz Web app. There is the camera.

23:16
From the browser, boom! Right into the camera.
Isn't that great? And now you can post a picture

23:21
and give Web developers the same type of capabilities
you would expect in a native application.

23:26
Glad that worked. No need for you guys to
visit the sandbox.

23:31
[ Applause ]
>>Vic Gundotra: Getting back to the speech

23:35
demonstration, what we showed you was capability
that we make available to developers, but

23:40
what about accessing that capability from
the browser? Here is a Web app.

23:45
It is a translate app from Google with one
new feature. You will note the microphone

23:51
right there at the top. Matt, if you could
just point to the microphone. There it is.

23:54
And watch what Matt does.
>>Matt: Can you help me find the nearest hospital?

24:09
>>> (repeating in French).
>>Vic Gundotra: Awesome! Awesome!

24:13
[ Applause ]
>>Vic Gundotra: All right. Let's go back to

24:17
slides.
Now, we're not only committed to making sure

24:25
that Android -- You can clap. I will let you
clap.

24:29
[ Applause ]
[ Cheering and Applause ]

24:32
>>Vic Gundotra: You know, I love it when I
don't even have to speak to a slide and we

24:38
just get applause.
[ Laughter ]

24:40
>>Vic Gundotra: I am so tempted to go on.
But let me just make a point here. We are

24:44
not only committed to having the world's fastest
browser. We're committed to having the world's

24:50
most comprehensive browser.
It turns out that on the Internet, people

24:54
use Flash!
[ Laughter ]

24:56
[ Applause ]
>>Vic Gundotra: And part of being open means

25:01
you are inclusive, rather than exclusive.
And you are open to innovation.

25:07
You know, this was driven home to me very
powerfully when my daughter picked up my iPad

25:14
and went to her favorite Web site, Web site
nickelodeon, and this is what she saw on the

25:18
iPad.
Can we switch to the iPad? A sea of orange!

25:25
[ Laughter ]
>>Vic Gundotra: She said, "Daddy, can I play

25:30
with your Android device?" And this is what
she saw.

25:34
The full nickelodeon site. Isn't that great?
That's what openness means.

25:39
[ Applause ]
>>Vic Gundotra: And by the way, a special

25:44
thanks to Adobe for their incredible willingness
to work with us, engage with us on Android

25:49
and in chrome and in many other areas. It's
really fun to work with other folks in the

25:54
ecosystem to meet the needs of users.
Much nicer than just saying no.

26:01
[ Applause ]
>>Vic Gundotra: All right. Let's go back to

26:04
slides.
Now, we have also made significant improvements

26:13
in the Android Marketplace.
We listened carefully to the feedback we have

26:19
gotten from developers and from users, and
I think you are going to like the enhancements.

26:23
Let's talk about what we have done on average,
our data shows that our users are installing

26:28
more than 40 apps on their Android device,
so finding those apps is a challenge. Also

26:35
they want to search within the data of those
apps, they want to move those apps to the

26:39
SD card, and they want to update all without
having to update each individual app by themselves.

26:46
Let me show you through a series of demos
what we have done here. Let's go to demos.

26:51
The first demonstration we are going to show
you is just searching the apps. Now with the

26:55
Quick Search box we make it trivially easy
to scope it to apps. As soon as you start

26:59
typing a letter, the app you are looking for
just comes up.

27:02
It's a simple and easy way to go find apps.
Not only can you find apps, but we have improved

27:08
the Quick Search box so developers can plug
into the search framework. In that case that

27:14
icon is for Mint. Mint is a financial application,
and now you are searching within the data

27:20
of that application bringing up your financial
records.

27:23
We think developers are going to extend this
in all sorts of exciting ways, making not

27:27
only Android more usable, but their own applications
be surface, discoverable, and more fun and

27:33
engaging for the user.
Another issue we have heard is people want

27:38
to take advantage of the openness of Android,
the ability for you to plug in an SD card

27:42
with arbitrary amounts of memory. And they
want to move apps not just in the internal

27:46
memory but off to the SD card.
Two points. We've enabled that capability

27:52
in a secure way with Froyo, but we have also
made it so the user never has to worry about

27:57
it. When they install an application, we will
intelligently look at the space and if appropriate,

28:02
move it to the SD card. If the user wants
to get involved and manually move things around,

28:08
that's what this demonstration shows. In this
case, Matt is going to take a brand-new game,

28:13
Need for Speed, and he is going to shift that
game from the internal memory onto the SD

28:18
card. There you go. The whole 50 megabytes
is being moved over. Why don't we just start

28:23
the game. Why don't you launch that game.
You can see it's on the SD card.

28:27
Why don't you launch that game. Isn't that
awesome? Great new game, Need for Speed, and

28:36
it can live on your SD card.
Okay. Let's move on.

28:39
[ Laughter ]
>>Vic Gundotra: Matt, Matt, we have got to

28:45
go. I know the game is fun.
All right. Let's go into the marketplace and

28:49
talk about....
[ Laughter ]

28:53
>>Vic Gundotra: All right. Let's talk about
update all functionality.

29:00
Matt, that's you.
[ Laughter ]

29:01
>>Vic Gundotra: He is easily distracted.
All right. Today, you have to update each

29:08
application individually. In Froyo, we have
made it simple. At the bottom of the Android

29:13
Marketplace you see the update all button.
[ Applause ]

29:15
>>Vic Gundotra: I am kind of embarrassed you
have to clap on that. We're glad it's there.

29:24
We have gone one step further with Froyo.
Why should the user have to take any action?

29:30
Starting with Froyo, with the user's permission
you can allow automatic updating, and all

29:34
your apps are updated all the time. Isn't
that great?

29:39
[ Applause ]
>>Vic Gundotra: And the user doesn't have

29:42
to worry about this at all.
Let's go back to slides.

29:51
Another key feature we're adding in Froyo
is designed to meet the needs of developers.

29:56
We want the best apps on Android, the highest
quality apps. And that means we need to close

30:01
the loop when there's a problem.
Let's go back to a demonstration here, and

30:05
I am going to show you an app called crashy.
It does exactly that really well. Matt, why

30:11
don't you start the app, and it crashed.
Note there's a button there called Report.

30:17
The user can press Report, can provide a description
of what happened. They can look at all the

30:24
data they are going to send, make sure they
are comfortable with that data and they can

30:29
hit send. And that is sent back to the developer.
Note on this screen the Android Marketplace,

30:35
note a brand-new tab, "Bugs." And when you
click on bugs we will show you those reports

30:42
for your application, and we will show you
the entire stack trace of what happened.

30:46
[ Applause ]
>>Vic Gundotra: We thought you might like

30:57
that. And closing the loop, allowing apps
to get better and better.

31:02
All right. Let's go back to slides.
I want to go a little bit beyond Froyo and

31:12
show you a sneak peek at other exciting things
that we are doing in the Android Marketplace.

31:17
I think you are going to like some of these
things. Let's go back to demo.

31:21
Matt is now showing you the Android Marketplace,
except this is unlike anything you have ever

31:27
seen before. It's the Android Marketplace
accessible from a browser on a PC, and that's

31:32
great.
Matt can browse apps, he can look at reviews,

31:39
but you will look up in the upper right-hand
corner, Matt is signed in, and because he

31:44
is signed in, we know every Android device
that he has.

31:48
[ Laughter ]
>>Vic Gundotra: Yeah, he is a little weird.

31:53
In this case, the device that he has on the
stage, he has selected at nutter butter, nutty

31:58
buddy, something. Like I said, he is weird.
He has got his phone selected, and so now

32:03
he can go browse a particular app. He is going
to find an app he likes like Open Table. Hold

32:08
on, hold on Matt. He is going to hit free
and he is going to go and download the app.

32:13
What do you think happens? Let's see, what
happens today on some other systems. You find

32:18
the app, you download it to your PC or Mac.
You then have to tether your device. Once

32:25
it's on your PC, you have to then convert
it over that tethering to your device and

32:30
then make that sync happen. Well, guess what?
We discovered something really cool. It's

32:35
called the Internet.
[ Laughter ]

32:38
>>Vic Gundotra: And when Matt presses download,
keep your eye on the Android device.

32:45
[ Applause ]
>>Vic Gundotra: Over the air.

32:57
Isn't that totally great? Over the air, installed
on your device.

33:02
Now, it turns out it's called the Android
 -- or the Marketplace because it's more than

33:06
apps. In fact, what we are about to show you
is a new category.

33:11
How about some music?
Matt, why don't you find an album or song

33:20
you like, and why don't you just send it to
the device using the Internet, over the air.

33:29
And boom, keep your eye on the Android device.
There you go. There is the music coming right

33:33
on down.
[ Cheering and Applause ]

33:40
>>Vic Gundotra: Now, we're not done yet. Some
of you may be thinking this is really cool,

33:48
this is so hot, but I have my music already
on my device at home, my Windows media or

33:54
my iTunes library. I have thousands of songs
there. What do I do with those?

33:59
We recently acquired a company called Simplified
Media and it is our intention to incorporate

34:04
that technology into the marketplace as well
and that allows you at home to run a simple

34:09
piece of hardware that makes all your non-DRM
music available to your Android device. Would

34:13
you like to see this? Let's go to your Android
device.

34:17
Android device has two songs on it. That's
nice, but I want more than two songs. I want

34:24
all my music I have.
So Matt will go down and select -- I guess

34:29
he has to plug in the device so you can hear
it.

34:32
>>> Options, touch nine. Thank you for calling
the fifth floor restaurant.

34:39
>>Vic Gundotra: My God!
[ Applause ]

34:43
[ Laughter ]
>>Vic Gundotra: Let me offer a public apology.

34:48
Now.
[ Laughter ]

34:49
>>Vic Gundotra: You know what's really odd?
Is that they didn't pick up all that time.

34:55
[ Laughter ]
>>Vic Gundotra: Wow!

34:58
Getting back to music. Two songs. I want all
my music. He is going to select that button

35:03
that says all, and magically, all the music
is now available.

35:07
Now, you might be wondering what just happened?
We are making your whole music library available

35:13
to your Android device as a stream. So, for
example, if Matt was to select a particular

35:18
song, I guess Matt's an Earth, Wind and Fire
fan, hit play. Will this work?

35:26
(music playing).
[ Applause ]

35:29
>>Vic Gundotra: Yeah, we think users are going
to love this feature.

35:44
All right. Let's go back to slides.
Let's talk a little bit about advertising.

35:58
It turns out that we know a little bit about
advertising. Today happens or this year happens

36:05
to be Google's tenth anniversary of providing
advertising solutions. And we have learned

36:11
a few things in that decade.
One of the foremost things we have learned

36:16
is if you want to have a healthy ecosystem
of advertising, you need advertisers. And

36:22
we have hundreds of thousands of them.
That means if you have an ad spot, we have

36:28
a relevant ad that can fill it. It's called
inventory.

36:33
We're not new at this game. We're not working
with a handful of partners and charging them

36:37
a million dollars each to be a part of our
program.

36:40
Okay? So we can be your advertising partner.
We have also learned something else in that

36:46
decade. That advertisers and accomplishers
have different kinds of needs.

36:52
There are local advertisers, there's direct
response advertisers, there are brand advertisers.

36:58
And if you want to play, you need formats
that meet the needs of those kinds of advertisers.

37:04
And we have those formats.
A third thing that we have learned, advertising

37:09
needs to be measured. And that means it needs
to have great tools.

37:15
Why does it need to be measured? Well, you
need to know if the money you are spending

37:18
is giving you a return on the investment.
You need to know which campaigns are working

37:22
so you can invest more in them or tweak them
as necessary.

37:25
And it turns out that we have some tools you
might have heard of called DoubleClick, analytics,

37:32
AdSense, AdWords? The tools the industry knows
and loves are being used seamlessly to work

37:41
in the mobile environment.
And finally, we know it's important to be

37:44
open to innovation.
Now, I don't even know what the ponies have

37:47
to do with this slide, but part of being open
is when you get a designer who gives you a

37:53
slide, you go with it.
[ Laughter ]

37:55
>>Vic Gundotra: Let's show you each one of
these four points and go to demos.

38:04
Now, these are real advertisers and real applications.
Let me make that point clear. You are looking

38:09
at Backgrounds. One of the most popular applications
available in the Android Marketplace.

38:14
At the top, you are looking at a Google ad.
Our ad program, which has been available only

38:19
to a limited number of beta participants,
is called AdSense for Mobile Apps, AFMA, and

38:25
you are looking at one of those AFMA ads.
You are looking at our large inventory of

38:29
text ads being optimized and served on that
device. We are taking advantage of the small

38:35
space we have and you are seeing the nice
rotation. That's just one ad format. What

38:40
happens if Matt selects something like beaches?
Then we can serve a contextually relevant

38:44
ad. In this case, Kayak is a popular Web site,
an application for travel. But in this case

38:51
when you click on the ad, we take you to deep
within the Android Marketplace so the user

38:57
can download the app. That's another important
ad format.

39:01
Let's show you another format.
This is a third format for brand advertising.

39:07
In other words, a banner ad where an advertiser
has decided to convey their message through

39:12
an image. We support that.
How about another category, and this is something

39:16
that we are announcing available today, and
that's an expandable ad format.

39:22
One of the things that we have seen through
our research is that users, if at all possible,

39:26
would like to stay within the context of the
application they are using.

39:29
So in this case, when Matt selects that Volkswagen
ad, it expands right out, you can look at

39:35
that ad and when he is done with it he can
simply make it slide right back in.

39:40
We think that's great for advertisers, and
we think that's great for users.

39:43
That expandable format is available today.
Let me show you another brand-new one we are

39:47
making available today. This is an expandable
ad format. This is a Flixter application.

39:52
Why don't you expand that ad out. In this
case it's not just display; it's rich media.

39:58
He is linking directly to a trailer. He clicked
on it and the trailer will begin and the movie

40:04
will go ahead and start.
Matt, don't watch the movie. Let's come back.

40:09
Let me show you another ad format. This is
also an expandable ad format, but in this

40:19
case, this expandable ad format has -- I'm
sorry, in this case -- I jumped ahead of you.

40:24
Let's go back to the other one.
In this case I am going to show you a very

40:26
popular ad format that has been testing incredibly
well. This is a click-to-call ad.

40:33
In this case we are leveraging the fact that
the user has given us permission to use their

40:36
location. We know that they are in San Francisco,
and DirecTV would like to make a special offer

40:42
to customers in San Francisco and they have
a new click-to-call option. So simply clicking

40:46
on that button on that ad allows the customer
to make that phone call to DirecTV, and that's

40:52
incredibly valuable.
Let me talk about another format. This is

40:55
an expandable format with a clever twist.
Matt, expand that one out. It includes a map

41:02
and directions and click-to-call. Isn't that
great? That's a new format that will become

41:07
shortly available as well.
Okay. Finally, let me show what you I meant

41:13
when I said open to innovation.
This is the weather.com application, and they

41:19
are using the industry standard DoubleClick
software to serve this ad from Google.

41:24
The ad is at the bottom.
Now, when Matt clicks on that ad, you get

41:27
a full screen immersive ad, and it's a pretty
amazing ad. It's got trailers and TV spots

41:33
and galleries. Not only does it have a bunch
of media you can interact with, look at the

41:37
bottom there. The bottom has the ability for
you to tap directly into fandango to purchase

41:42
movie tickets.
But do you know what the kicker is of what

41:45
you are seeing? It's not a Google ad. You
are seeing an immersive ad format delivered

41:52
by a great advertising company called MediaLabs.
But because the advertiser -- excuse me the,

41:59
ISB, the developer used DoubleClick to serve
the ads, DoubleClick is open to have any ads

42:04
show up. And that's what it means to be open.
That we serve the most relevant ad to the

42:09
user, sometimes from Google, sometimes not,
but you the developer and the publisher have

42:16
the choice.
If would you like to learn more about our

42:22
advertising solutions, we encourage you to
go to google.com/mobileads.

42:30
And we are opening up AFMA, AdSense for Mobile
Apps, to everybody at the conference, all

42:37
5,000 of you.
And we're going to sweeten the deal a little

42:44
bit.
If you go sign up, we will give you $100 free

42:47
advertising credit to start learning the system
and advertise your apps in the Android Marketplace.

42:51
So, please, go try that out.
[ Applause ]

42:56
>>Vic Gundotra: One of the most powerful ways
to demonstrate what I talked about at the

43:03
beginning, that innovation comes from all
levels of the stack, is to highlight one of

43:09
my favorite devices.
This is the device by HTC.

43:14
It's the EVO device.
Now, there are several things I love about

43:18
this device.
One thing I love about the device is, its

43:20
absolutely gorgeous 4.3-inch screen.
I also love how fast it is.

43:26
I love the great work HTC has done to add
value.

43:29
I love the Sprint network.
It's a 4G network.

43:32
You know what a 4G network can do?
It can give you a peak of 10 megabits per

43:36
second.
Imagine what you can watch on this device

43:38
at 10 megabits per second.
I love the fact that this device has a great

43:44
little stand.
You can set it on the desk, or if you're on

43:47
an airplane, just set it right there and watch
your content.

43:51
It's got a great battery.
It's got HDMI output.

43:53
It's got a camera that's 8 megapixels and
that will do 720p HD video recording.

44:00
And you know what I love most about this device?
Is that in partnership with Sprint and HTC,

44:07
Google is going to make this device available
to every one of you today.

44:12
[ Cheers and applause ]
>>Vic Gundotra: Now, for those of you who

44:33
are watching on YouTube, I'm sorry.
[ Laughter ]

44:36
>>Vic Gundotra: Remember to register next
year, quickly.

44:42
I think you're going to love that device.
We ask you to do two things.

44:45
Number one, don't run out right now.
After the keynotes are over, we're going to

44:50
make it available all day until 6:00 p.m.
So you'll have plenty of time to get this

44:54
device and really get to see the latest in
Android innovation.

44:58
Number two thing we're going to ask.
Thank you for supporting Android.

45:04
Thank you for voting on the side of openness
and choice.

45:09
[ Cheers and applause ]
>>Vic Gundotra: Please keep building those

45:18
great apps.
Now, we're at the halfway point this morning.

45:23
We're not done yet.
If you'd like to see the next step in the

45:28
evolution of Android and where we're about
to go next, hang tight.
