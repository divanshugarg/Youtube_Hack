Firefox is a must for the software to work.

Steps to download the transcript from Youtube videos:

1. Download the entire source in a single folder.
2. Run 'Youtube_Hack.exe'.
3. You will be asked to enter the complete address for the video whose transcript needs to be downloaded. For eg. "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY3U2GXhz44" (without quotes).
4. Wait for the hack to run the script, which might take 10-15 seconds.
5. The transcript will be downloaded in the 'subtitles.txt' file.

Cheers!
